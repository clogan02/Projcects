Personal Coding Projects

This project was created for the Steam Your Dreams internship project submission. 
The project was made following the instructions from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq&index=1&pp=iAQB
The time taken to make this project was about as much time as it takes to get to the transitioning between maps video, with anything that is original to me (things like the mazes and designs)
taking about an hour or two.

Some technical considerations:
Player cannot move diagonally
When interacting with certain npcs or objects, the player must be walking into them in order for a dialogue box to appear.

The finished game can be found here:
